There are many problems with the current approach:

1) For compiled code, the DLL are kept in memory, and rapidly reach a limit, causing the error:

Loading required package: spatial
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
  unable to load shared object '/usr/lib/R/library/spatial/libs/spatial.so':
  `maximal number of DLLs reached...
Error in as.vector(lsf.str(paste("package:", package_name, sep = ""))) : 
  error in evaluating the argument 'x' in selecting a method for function 'as.vector': Error in as.environment(pos) : 
  no item called "package:spatial" on the search list
Calls: lsf.str

Meaning that the package is not loaded.
